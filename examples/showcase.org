* Headlines and Structure
This is the top-level headline (Level 1). It usually represents the main project or document section.

** Level 2 Headline
Notice how the high contrast helps differentiate between the text and the structure.
*** Level 3 Headline
**** Level 4 Headline
***** Level 5 Headline
****** Level 6 Headline
Even at deep nesting levels, the theme remains readable.

* Formatting and Markup
Org-mode supports various types of text decoration:
- *Bold text* for emphasis.
- /Italicized text/ for a softer touch.
- _Underlined text_ for clarity.
- +Strikethrough text+ for deleted items.
- ~Code snippets~ and =Verbatim= text for technical notes.

** Links and Footnotes
You can have [[https://github.com/rails-to-cosmos/danneskjold-theme][External Links]] which use the =frost= color, or internal footnotes[fn:1].

* Task Management
The theme highlights the status of your workflow:

- TODO This is an active task using the =yellow= face.
- DONE This is a completed task using the =green= face.
- WAIT This is a task on hold.

** Tags and Priorities
- [#A] High Priority Task :urgent:work:
- [#B] Medium Priority Task :maintenance:
- [#C] Low Priority Task :optional:

* Blocks and Source Code
The theme provides a distinct background for blocks to make code stand out from prose.

#+begin_src elisp
(defun hello-danneskjold ()
